If u give Thread.currentThread() , it will display or show the results of currently executing
method or class ..Like if u have one Thread class and make instance of it in the main method ,
it will display the results of the execution of the main only ..
 
 SO currentThread means it refers the current execution where is currently executing.


 Blocked State:-
 If the thread enters a blocked state means it is waiting to acquire a lock where the other thread 
 holds .if it gets the lock then it will proceed .

 Blocked state occurs when the thread tries to access syncronized block or method where
  the other thread is executing that method.

  join() method .. THe join method is used to pause the execution of current thread and waits for the called thread
  to finish its execution,

  like if u have a Mythread class which extends thread and ,
  u call that class in the main method and create a instance of it and , if u give the join method to 
  that instance .. It wil execute the MyThread first and main method will wait for completeion of execution before moving to other thread .
  

  The purpose of join method is for synchronizing thread.
  It helps one thread to execute at a time before proceeding further.


  When to use Thread extends or implements Runnable?
  When there is a class that is already extended by other class then u cant use Thread,
  becuz java supports only single inheritance ,In that case use Runnable.

  Using Threads extends can be less efficient compared to the runnable becaus of 
  n situations where multiple threads need to share the same task (because each thread would 
  need to be a separate instance of the Thread class).
And also Runnable supports reusablity So its more efficient.
